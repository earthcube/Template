This repository provides a recommended template for GitHub repositories hosting 
[EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/info/about) project work.  It is based on a template set up by Simon Goring for the Throughput project organization repositories.

# Objective

The readme files in a repository should provide sufficient information for a technically proficient user to understand what is in the repository and how it can be used. This includes explaining the intended function of any software, links to documentation, an outline of how the content of the repository is organized, and brief explanation of the content. Detailed information should be provided in documents linked from the readme file.

If the repository is used for software development, there should be clear instructions on how to clone the repository and set up a development environment, and an explanation of policies for contributing updates to the project. 

# What's here
- TemplateREADME.md -- this is a template for the readme file in the root of the repository. The template includes an outline of recommended content for the readme. Edit the template file, rename or remove this readme.md file, and rename TemplateREADME.md to README.md.
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md -- suggested code of conduct guidance for project participants
- Directories -- the directories in the template are suggestions.  If you have content that fits these categories, please follow these naming conventions, but other directories can be added as necessary.
 -- src -- Any scripts that are not the primary coding scripts should be placed in this folder
 -- figures -- figures and illustrations for the project. Typically pdf, tif, jpg or other vector or raster image files.
 -- data -- any data packaged with the project or necessary for its function.
