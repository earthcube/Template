This repository provides a recommended template for GitHub repositories hosting 
[EarthCube](https://www.earthcube.org/info/about) project work.  

# Objective

The readme files in a repository should provide sufficient information for a technically proficient user to understand what is in the repository and how it can be used. This includes explaining the intended function of any software, links to documentation, an outline of how the content of the repository is organized, and brief explanation of the content. Detailed information should be provided in documents linked from the readme file.

If the repository is used for software development, there should be clear instructions on how to clone the reposiotry and set up a development environment, and an explanation of policies for contributing updates to the project.
