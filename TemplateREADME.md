### License
All EarthCube products must have a clear and explicit statement of license terms.  Which license to use is up to individual projects. Some useful resources for learning about licenses include [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/)and [Open Source Licenses in 2020: Trends and Predictions](https://resources.whitesourcesoftware.com/blog-whitesource/top-open-source-licenses-trends-and-predictions)

EarthCube discourages use of copy-left licenses because they can complicate reuse of a resource. Permissive license appropriate for software developers such as [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) or [Apache 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) are widely used in the community. 

For documents and other creative works where one wants to reserve copyright or get credit, [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) is a good choice. [CC0 (no rights reserved)](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0) is a good choice to put materials and data into the international public domain without restriction. The Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) community uses both [CC-BY and CC0 in its hosted content](http://commons.esipfed.org/node/1447), including vocabularies and ontologies.
